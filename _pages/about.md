I am a research engineer at [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr). I am currently interested in cryptography, especially fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Since joining CryptoLab in 2021, I have been developing and maintaining the [HEaaN library](https://heaan.it/) and actively engaging in academic research on fully homomorphic encryption.

I will be starting a computer science PhD program at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) from this fall.
