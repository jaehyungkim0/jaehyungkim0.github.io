I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). I am currently interested in cryptography, especially on theories for building privacy preserving applications.
