I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). I am currently interested in cryptography, especially on theories for building privacy preserving applications.

Before joining Stanford, I had worked as a research engineer at [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr) for 3 years. I actively engaged in academic research and software development on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).
